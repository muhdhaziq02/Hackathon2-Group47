## SISWA SIMULATOR

### Description of our game
Siswa Simulator is an exciting text-based simulator game that puts you in the shoes of a Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) freshman student who finds yourself lost in campus and must navigate through the whole map to make it back to your room. Being a freshman, you are trying to get back to your room and have little to no clue on the directions. Along the way, you will encounter various things and have the chance to get to know more on the campus' hidden gems and myths. Immerse yourself in the thrilling journey of survival, discovery and exploration within the confines of USM ground.

As you delve deeper into the game, you'll unravel numerous mind blowing features of USM. Will you uncover the campus's dark secrets and successfully escape, or will you succumb to the challenges and remain trapped forever?

The game is played by interacting with the text-based interface through commands entered by you.
### Features of the game:
1. Room-based navigation: The game is structured around different locations that players can move between.
2. Object interaction: Players can interact with objects within the game world.
4. Objective-based gameplay: The game includes a specific goal that players need to accomplish to complete the game.

### How to play the game:
To play the game, players must enter a command based on the options given through a text-based interface. They can explore different locations, interact with objects and complete the quest to progress in the game.

### How object-oriented concepts were used to develop the game:
Object-oriented concepts are commonly used in game development to organize and structure code. In our game, object-oriented programming (OOP) have been employed to represent various entities within the game, such as locations, objects, characters, and the player itself. Each of these entities can be represented as objects with their own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

For instance, objects and characters in the game are represented as classes, with their own attributes and behaviors. This approach allows for modular and organized code, making it easier to manage and expand the game's functionality.

### How linked lists play a role in the game:
Linked lists are a data structure commonly used in programming. Linked lists had been used to represent sequences, collections of objects and events in the game.

For example, in this game, it has a sequence of actions or events that need to occur in a specific order. A linked list is used to maintain and traverse that sequence. Each node in the linked list could an action or event and the list's links would connect them in the correct order. This allows for easy iteration and management of the sequence.

Overall, the use of linked lists in our game depends on the specific mechanics or features we have implemented, but they can provide a convenient way to organize and manipulate ordered collections of data.
